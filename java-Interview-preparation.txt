3. What is JVM Garbage collection?
Ans.   Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run 
on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short. When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program. 
Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.

4. Any 3 types of Garbage Collection and How to set it?
Ans.   1.Serial Garbage Collector
       2.Parallel Garbage Collector
	   3. CMS Garbage Collector
	We can set it by running it through command prompt by this commnd java '-XX:+<name of GC> -jar Application.java' like for parllel command 
	would be 'java -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar Application.java'
